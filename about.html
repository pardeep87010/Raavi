            <h2>Brand Story</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Initial Foray</h3>
                <p>The journey of Tanishq started with the launch of 18k gold watches studded with precious stones in 1994. But, it soon grew into a 22K jeweller who presented a stunning range of gold and diamond jewellery. The term Tanishq was coined by Mr. Xerxes Desai by marrying the words ‘Tan’ meaning body and ‘Nishk’ meaning a gold ornament and Tanishq’s very first state-of-art jewellery factory with a proper karigaar park was set up in Hosur in Tamil Nadu.</p>
